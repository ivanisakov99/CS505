# Assignment 5 (100 pts) - Transformers for Language Modeling and Classification
In this assignment, you will learn about implementing Transformers using HuggingFace library for language modeling and text classification, and use the deep learning framework Pytorch. The assignment will ask you to follow tutorials written in Google Colab while answering some questions and modifying the tutorials.
